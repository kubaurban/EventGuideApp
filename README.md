# Event managing app

## Project description

Project's subject is an application for managing one particular event during its lifetime. It should also present some functionalities before event beginning but a core of application functionality will cover only event's lifetime.

Major purpose of the application is to provide event participants with:

- static\* agenda with brief information of each agenda item:
  - speaker,
  - concise description,
  - duration (start and end time),
  - place,
  - type of activity.

- each event day having a separate bookmark with its agenda

- real time tracking of agenda items (the application generates notification before\*\*\*\* each\*\* agenda item),

- staying up-to-date\*\*\* with organizers' announcements (placed by them during the event on an intended board in the application)

- see and download any earlier provided by organizers documents, texts or other attachments related to the event (e.g. event regulations, list of special guests with their photos and concise description, event description or aim, ...)
